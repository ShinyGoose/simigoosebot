Polarity is only meaningful in relation to something else. There are also about 4/5 measures of polarity that are determined by highly technical p-chem-y stuff. It's also different depending on whether you are looking at solubility or chromatography or what.",
  "H-bonding. Don't even get me started. When I started my graduate studies my professor gave me an entire BOOK on hydrogen bonding. Two of my professors had a decades long friendly feud about whether or not certain interactions can be called a hydrogen bond. The IUPAC had a committee that met for YEARS to figure out what can and cannot be called hydrogen bonding. This actually goes for all intermolecular interactions.",
